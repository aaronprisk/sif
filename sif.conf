# PAIRHOST should be an IP address of your secondary KVM host that is reachable via ICMP echo (ping) requests.
PAIRHOST=""

# FAILHOST is the backup address that SIF will attempt to contact to ensure a true host failure.
# Best practice would be to use a VM ip address or secondary interface on host.
FAILHOST=""

# FAILGW is an address of a reachable gateway the localhost should have consistent access to.
# Best practice is to set this to your default gateway.
FAILGW=""

# PING INTERVAL is the frequency in seconds that SIF will try to contact PAIRHOST to ensure uptime.
# A very low interval might cause network problems so adjust carefully.
PING_INTERVAL=60

# VM TIMEOUT is the time in seconds SIF will give a VM to gracefully shutdown via ACPI before force power off.
# Best practice depends largely on your environment and number of VMs that have to shut down.
VM_TIMEOUT=120
