**S**imple **I**ntegrated **F**ailover

**SIF** is a simple tool for dual host KVM clusters. It's intended to be a turnkey, hands free tool for keeping your virtual machines highly available and limiting downtime in the case of a host failure.

Please note that SIF is in early development and is not recommended for production use.
